        <p>
          Eddie Sanchez is a senior majoring
          in broadcast journalism and minoring in motion pictures. He currently serves
          as a sports anchor for UMTV's Spanish news show, UniMiami, and a reporter for
          the award-winning English news show Newsvision. In addition, he is the multimedia
          online editor for the campus newspaper, The Miami Hurricane.

          Upon graduating high school in 2011, Sanchez interned with Univision Network.
          Here he had the opportunity to work with journalism professionals and
          collaborate on big projects from Sabado Gigante, Noticiero Univision,
          Despierta America, and special events. His most recent involvement with
          Univision was the 2014 World Cup. Eddie transferred to the University of Miami
          from Miami Dade College as a junior and immediately began working on UMTV shows.
          Sanchez enjoys spending free time with his family, training for marathon races,
          and playing volleyball in South Beach. As a Costa Rican American, Sanchez
          aspires to be the first Hispanic anchor of Good Morning America.
